## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Hybrid 3-layer deployment architecture:
  - **Layer 1: Vercel** (free, no CC) — frontend + serverless API for videy.co direct resolve
  - **Layer 2: GitHub Codespaces** (free, 60h/month) — 1-click full backend with Playwright
  - **Layer 3: Local / Docker** (free, forever) — full functionality via clone & run
- Serverless function at `frontend/api/v1/extract.ts` for videy.co direct URL resolution
- Vercel configuration with SPA rewrites (`frontend/vercel.json`)
- GitHub Codespaces dev container (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)
- Provider status indicators in frontend UI (shows which work on live demo vs need backend)
- README section explaining architecture decision with full rationale
- Pre-commit hooks via Husky + lint-staged (auto tsc + eslint before every commit)
- Docker Compose for one-command local development (backend + frontend)
- `.env.example` with all configurable environment variables
- CI/CD badges in README

## [1.0.0-beta] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite (99 tests): 70 unit, 22 schema validation, 7 integration
- Custom error hierarchy with typed status codes:
  - `ExtractError` (base), `BrowserMissingError` (503), `NoMediaFoundError` (404)
  - `UpstreamFetchError` (502), `ValidationError` (400)
- Structured logging via Pino (JSON in production, pretty-print in development)
- Zod-validated environment configuration with fail-fast startup
- Support for `silent` log level (used during tests)

### Changed
- **Massive refactor:** Monolithic `extractor.ts` (690 lines) split into 9 focused modules:
  - `browser.ts` — Playwright lifecycle management
  - `helpers.ts` — Pure utility functions (17 functions)
  - `schemas.ts` — Zod validation schemas
  - `routes.ts` — Express route handlers
  - `errors.ts` — Custom error classes
  - `providers/videy.ts` — Videy.co direct URL resolver
- All `console.log` replaced with structured Pino logging
- All `error: any` replaced with `error: unknown` + `instanceof` pattern
- All empty catch blocks addressed (logged or documented as intentional)
- Main entry point (`index.ts`) now uses config/logger modules
- CORS configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Global error handler no longer leaks stack traces to clients
- Rate limiting applied to both extract and download endpoints

### Removed
- `src/extractor.ts` (monolithic file, split into modules)
- `src/test_extract.ts`, `src/test_playvvip.ts` (obsolete test scripts, replaced by Vitest suite)

### Fixed
- `ReadableStream` type cast eliminated (uses `Readable.from()` directly)
- Test environment variable loading order (moved from `beforeAll` to Vitest `env` config)
- Coverage provider version aligned with Vitest
- Zod schema refine callback now handles malformed strings gracefully

### Changed
- Multiple Playwright user-agent adjustments to avoid bot detection
